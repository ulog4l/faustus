Offering precompiled fak firmware doesn't make much sense since any keymap on a board like this will require customization, if you can't compile fak you probably can't use this keyboard.\
however the keyboard.ncl form here has the necessary matrix definitons to make this work.\
Also the example keymap is just what I use personally but the fak repo has much more advanced exmamples of customization possible with fak.
