32 key [hummingbird](https://github.com/PJE66/hummingbird) adjacent keyboard, also taking inspiration from its variations, such as the [zilpzalp](https://github.com/kilipan/zilpzalp) thumb keys\
also credits to [ergogen](ergogen.cache.works) for simplifying the key placement tremendously\
exclusively supports choc switches, is choc spaced\
exclusively supports the [MIAO](https://github.com/kilipan/miao) controller and [FAK firmware](https://github.com/semickolon/fak)

this keyboard essentially restores the middle column to a hummingbird, making it possible to not combo for these keys and ruin your muscle memory for all other keyboards\
this is made possible by the miao having additional IO pins, removing the 30 key limit of the xiao that is used in the hummingbird

this keyboard uses BAV70 diodes

this pcb has some mounting tabs meant to provide freedom in designing cases, but sticking adhesive feet to the bottom is the lowest profile variant possible and therefore preferred

while i personally have working versions with both hotswap sockets and soldered switches i will of course not take any responsibility for the producteon files being functional, use them at your own risk
